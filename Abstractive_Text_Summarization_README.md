# Abstractive Text Summarization (NLP)

## 📌 Overview  
This project focuses on developing **abstractive text summarization models** to generate high-quality summaries of text documents. Leveraging deep learning approaches such as **seq2seq and transformer-based architectures**, the project demonstrates how Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be applied for automated media monitoring, news aggregation, and document analysis.
